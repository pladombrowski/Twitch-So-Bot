[Leia em PortuguÃªs (Read in Portuguese)](README.pt-br.md)

A Twitch bot that displays random clips, videos, or highlights from specified channels without relying on third-party services. The bot integrates with OBS to automatically show content when authorized users run the `!so` command in your Twitch chat.

- Twitch account
- Twitch Developer Application

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of `so_bot.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pladombrowski/so_bot/releases)
2. Run the executable on your computer
3. The application will open a browser window for Twitch authentication
4. After authentication, access the configuration page at http://localhost:5000/config

## Setup

### Twitch Developer Application

1. Go to [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/)
2. Register a new application
3. Choose a name for your application
4. In the "OAuth Redirect URLs" field, enter:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/auth/callback
   ```
5. Set the category to "Chat Bot"

7. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" for configuration

### OBS WebSocket Setup

1. In OBS, go to Tools > WebSocket Server Settings
2. Check "Enable WebSocket Server"
3. Click "Show Connection Info" to view your password
4. Note the server, port, and password for configuration

### Bot Configuration
